# Photometry Analysis

Perform a complete analysis on observational data of multiple star clusters to extract Be star data.

### Features:

* Read ```.als``` and ```.mag``` photometry files generated by IRAF ```daophot``` tasks
* Compile data with multiple exposure times and four filters: B, V, R, H-alpha
* Automatically calculate a constant or linear threshold or manually specify R-H threshold to define Be star candidates
* Plot color-magnitude diagrams and two-color diagrams (R-H vs. B-V color index) to visualize Be data
* Scale data sets for each night of observation to remove intrinsic night-to-night differences due to atmospheric effects, etc.
* Analyze the Be candidate photometry over time to determine transient behavior

### Requirements:

This program is written using ```Python 3.x``` and the following libraries:
* ```NumPy``` - Regular numerical calculations
* ```PyQt4``` - GUI interfacing
* ```scipy``` - Curve fitting using the ```linear_model``` module in ```scikit-learn```
* ```astropy``` - Reading ```.fits``` files and reading WCS tranformations for astrometry offsets
* ```Matplotlib``` - Plotting using the ```pyplot``` module
* ```mypytools``` - My custom module to make some basic processes easier to write

This program is developed in Windows OS, however the design of the program should allow OS-independence (however untested).
