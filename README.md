# Photometry Processing

Perform a complete analysis on observational data of multiple star clusters to extract Be star data.

### Current Version

* Read .als and .mag photometry files generated by IRAF DaoPhot tasks
* Compile data with multiple exposure times and four filters: B, V, R, H-alpha
* Automatically calculate or manually specify R-H threshold to define Be star candidates (automatic is untested)
* Plot color-magnitude diagrams and two-color diagrams (R-H vs. B-V color index) to visualize Be data
* Scale data sets for each night of observation to remove intrinsic night-to-night differences due to atmospheric effects, etc.
* Basic GUI (for now) for more interactive use (see below)
