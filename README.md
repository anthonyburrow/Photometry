# Photometry Analysis

Perform a complete analysis on observational data of multiple star clusters to extract Be star data.

### Features:

* Read ```.als``` and ```.mag``` photometry files generated by IRAF ```daophot``` tasks
* Compile data with multiple exposure times and four filters: B, V, R, H-alpha
* Automatically calculate a constant or linear threshold or manually specify R-H threshold to define Be star candidates (automatic is untested)
* Plot color-magnitude diagrams and two-color diagrams (R-H vs. B-V color index) to visualize Be data
* Scale data sets for each night of observation to remove intrinsic night-to-night differences due to atmospheric effects, etc.
* Basic GUI (for now) for more interactive use (see below)

### Requirements:

This program is written using ```Python 3.x``` and the following libraries:
* ```NumPy``` - Regular numerical calculations
* ```PyQt4``` - GUI interfacing
* ```scikit-learn``` - Linear regression using the ```linear_model``` module
* ```astropy``` - Reading ```.fits``` files
* ```Matplotlib``` - Plotting using the ```pyplot``` module
* ```simplejson``` - Using JSON for sending information (only for uploading to Astrometry.net to automatically determine x- and y- coordinate offsets)

This program is developed to allow OS-independence (meaning Windows can be used), however some commands (specifically in determining coordinate offsets) are currently GNU-specific, meaning Linux is the optimal OS for use.  This may change in the future.
