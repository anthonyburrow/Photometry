These files are meant to make zeropoint calculation easier:

restructure.py -- outputs .mag files into a more readable frmat

ZP.pro -- calculates the zeropoints for the night of data based on multiple standard star magnitudes for each filter

ZP.py -- unfinished program meant to automate ZP.pro by allowing it to read any variable number of different images for each filter, instead of having to add more lines to ZP.pro for each additional image

aperturecorrect.pro -- meant to calculate aperture corrections for use in exact photometry calculations
